# 3D
(LeMul Implementation)/
This is only an implementation of a recently published paper as following:

@inproceedings{ho2021lemul,
      title={Toward Realistic Single-View 3D Object Reconstruction with Unsupervised Learning from Multiple Images},
      author={Long-Nhat Ho and Anh Tran and Quynh Phung and Minh Hoai},
      booktitle={Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision},
      year={2021}
}

I just created this repository to be able to manipulate the codes for some learning purposes. Please refer to the origianl repository at https://github.com/VinAIResearch/LeMul.git for more information.
